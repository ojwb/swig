            Fixes #540 reported by djack42.

2016-07-01: wsfulton
            Fix corner case of wrapping std::vector of T pointers where a pointer to a pointer of T
            also exists in the wrapped code. SF Bug 2359417 (967).

2016-06-26: wkalinin
            [Java, C#] Patch #681 Fix seg fault when ignoring nested classes.

2016-06-25: mromberg
            [Python] #711 Fix -castmode and conversion of signed and unsigned integer types.
            See 2015-12-23 CHANGES entry for details of these improvements when they were
            implemented for the default options (ie not using -castmode).

2016-06-25: ahnolds
            Patch #730 - Fix %implicitconv for overloaded functions when using
            -castmode or -fastdispatch options.

            The result is that in all overload cases where there are multiple possibilities
            with the same number of arguments, the dispatch function will first check for
            exact (aka non implicit) matches, and then subsequently check for implicit
            casting matches. This was already happening in the normal dispatch situation,
            and in the -fastdispatch case two passes through the candidates were happening,
            just with SWIG_POINTER_IMPLICIT_CONV always set. After this patch, it is not set
            on the first pass, and then set on the second pass.

2016-06-25: liorgold
            Patch #727 - Add support for C++11 type aliasing.
